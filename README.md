So most the stuff for this project is on my other repo (freddie-arcade)[https://github.com/hippogriff101/freddie-arcade].

But the new arcade rules came in and here I am.

THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED!!!

And I don't have the time to finish it.

Don't get me wrong Arcade has been an amazing experiance and I'd love to stay part of the comunity 
but I need to spend more time doing other stuff insted of spending the last weeks of year 7 and
the first weeks of the school hols cooped up spending HOURS a week on a screen.
I have NO clue how some people on here get 400 hours in 5 months.
My mum thinks arcade is run by 16 year olds.

I'm confused about aracde. It's fun.

I'm so sorry to the reviewr who has to read this whole paragraph and might fail the project because there have been over 5 diffent scrabook posts and two reop's.

I guess. Thanks Hack Club
